Passarelli, James V., Catherine M. Mauck, Samuel W. Winslow, Collin F. Perkinson, Jacob C. Bard, Hiroaki Sai, Kristopher W. Williams, Ashwin Narayanan, Daniel J. Fairfield, Mark P. Hendricks, William A. Tisdale, and Samuel I. Stupp. "Tunable exciton binding energy in two-dimensional hybrid layered perovskites through organic-layer donor-acceptor interactions."

There are three folders for fitting absorption spectra of thin films of compound 2 (Nap-O-Pr-NH3+)2PbI4 with 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0 equivalents of TCBQ with a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method in MATLAB.
